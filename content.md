# HTML & CSS Basics

Let’s get started with HTML & CSS — the languages behind everything you see on the web.

## Just Plain Text

HTML starts simple. When you create an .html file and type 'Hello, world!':

```html
Hello, world!
```
{: .repl }

The browser will show exactly that. No styling. No structure. Just text. It’s your blank canvas.

## Links That Go Places

<!-- TODO: add what html stands for -->

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. The "HyperText" part is all about links — connecting one page to another.

You can make a link using the `<a>` tag (short for "anchor"):

```html
<a href="https://youtu.be/Aq5WXmQQooo">Click me! 😎</a>
```
{: .repl }

The `href` attribute tells the browser where to go. The text between the tags is what the user clicks.

## What an HTML Element Looks Like

An HTML element usually has:

- An opening tag: `<tagname>`
- Some content: 'Content'
- A closing tag (indicated by slash `/`): `</tagname>`

```html
<tagname>Content</tagname>
```

Here’s an example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
{: .repl }

There’s an opening tag (`<p>`), content (This is a paragraph.), and a closing tag (`</p>`).

## Changing Style with One Attribute

You can style things right in your HTML using the `style` attribute:

```html
<p style="color: red;">Red text</p>
```
{: .repl }

This tells the browser to display the text in red. CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets** — it’s how we style HTML.

<aside>
Using a `style` attribute works, but 'inline styles' are generally considered a code smell. It’s better to use CSS style rules. (We'll show you how soon)
</aside>

## Using `<span>` to Style Part of a Sentence

What if you want to style just one word inside a paragraph? Use `<span>`. It’s an inline tag, meaning it doesn’t break the line.

```html
<p>I <span style="color: green;">love</span> HTML!</p>
<span> is great for styling small parts of text.
```
{: .repl }

## How to Show an Image

To add an image, use the `<img>` tag (short for "image"). It’s a self-closing tag (no closing `</img>` needed).

```html
<img src="https://http.cat/200" alt="A cute cat">
```
{: .repl }

- `src=`, the file path
- `alt=`, alternative text (shown if the image can’t load)

<aside>
`alt=` tags are also used by screen readers to describe the image.
</aside>

## How HTML Elements Fit Together

HTML is like a family tree. We often describe the relationship between elements as parent, child, and/or sibling.

```html
<div> <!-- grandparent -->
  <p> <!-- parent -->
    <span>Hello!</span> <!-- child -->
  </p>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

When tags go inside other tags we call this 'nesting'.

## Why Extra Spaces Don’t Show Up

HTML doesn’t care about how many spaces or line breaks you add. These two are the same:

```html
<p>This    is
a test.</p>
```
{: .repl }

The browser just shows: This is a test.

## How Pages Are Laid Out

HTML gives your page structure. CSS decides how things look and where they go. Together, they build the layout.

### The Default Layout: Flow

By default, HTML elements follow a top-to-bottom flow. Block-level tags (like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`) stack vertically. Inline tags (like `<span>`, `<a>`) sit next to each other in a row.

### What a `<div>` Is For

`<div>` stands for division. It’s a box that holds other elements. It doesn’t show anything by itself, but it helps group things:

```html
<div>
  <p>Inside the box!</p>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

It’s invisible unless you style it, but super useful for grouping content.

## Adding Borders and Rounded Corners

Want to make a box stand out? Add a border with the style attribute:

```html
<div style="border: 1px solid black;">Hello</div>
```
{: .repl }

Make the corners round with:

```html
<div style="border-radius: 10px;">Rounded box</div>
```

These are just a few (of many) CSS properties you can use to style elements.

## Aligning Text Left, Center, or Right

Use `text-align` to move text:

```html
<p style="text-align: center;">Centered text</p>
```
{: .repl }

Try `left`, `center`, or `right`.

## Understanding the Box Around Elements

Every element in HTML is treated like a box. This is called the box model:

<!-- TODO: add inspector screenshot -->

- **Content**: The actual text or image
- **Padding**: Space inside the box
- **Border**: The edge of the box
- **Margin**: Space outside the box

## How to Write CSS Style Rules

Instead of putting styles in the tag (inline), you can write them separately:

```html
<style>
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

This text remains black.

<p>This text is now blue.</p>
```
{: .repl }

This turns all text in a `<p>` tag blue.

## Choosing What to Style with CSS

You can tell CSS which elements to style using selectors:

```css
p { color: red; }         /* all paragraphs */
#main { font-size: 20px; } /* an element with id="main" */
.box { border: 1px solid; } /* anything with class="box" */
```

- Element selector
- `#`: ID selector
- `.`: Class selector

## Making Layouts with Flexbox

Flexbox is a layout tool that helps you arrange boxes in rows or columns.

```html
<div style="display: flex;">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

Now the boxes sit next to each other instead of stacking.

### Moving Items Side to Side

Use `justify-content` to control horizontal space (left, right, or center).

```html
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <div>Centered</div>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

Other options: `center`, `space-around`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`.

### Lining Items Up Top to Bottom

Use `align-items` to control vertical alignment.

```html
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div>Centered vertically</div>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

This is helpful when boxes have different heights.

## That’s It For Now

You now know the basics of how web pages are written and styled:

- ✅ HTML for structure
- ✅ CSS for style
- ✅ Flexbox for layout

Keep building, keep practicing — you’re off to a great start!
