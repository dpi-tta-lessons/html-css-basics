# HTML & CSS Basics

Let’s get started with HTML & CSS — the languages behind everything you see on the web.

## Just Plain Text

HTML starts simple. When you create an `.html` file and type 'Hello, world!':

```html
Hello, world!
```
{: .repl }

The browser will show exactly that. No styling. No structure. Just text. It’s your blank canvas.

## What Does "HTML" Mean?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.

Let’s break that down:

- **HyperText** means text that contains links — you can click to jump to another page or place.
- **Markup** means adding extra information around your content to tell the computer what it is or how it should be shown.

### Why "Markup"?

The word **markup** comes from the world of print publishing, where editors and printers would literally mark up manuscripts with instructions like "make this bold" or "this is a heading."

HTML works the same way — you're marking up plain text with tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, or `<a>` to give it meaning and structure.

### A Bit of History

The web was originally created to help researchers share documents (like academic papers). That’s why HTML was designed to describe the structure of content — not how it looks.

For example:

- `<h1>` means "this is a main heading"
- `<blockquote>` means "this is a quote"
- `<cite>` means "this is a source"

So, when you write HTML, you’re not just making things *appear* — you’re *describing* what they are.

## Links That Go Places

Now that you know what **HyperText** means, let’s try a link.

You can create one using the `<a>` tag — short for "anchor":

```html
<a href="https://youtu.be/Aq5WXmQQooo" target="_blank">Click me! 😎</a>
```
{: .repl }

- The `href` *attribute* with a *value* `https://youtu.be/Aq5WXmQQooo` tells the browser where to go.
- The `target` *attribute* with a *value* `_blank` tells the browser to open this link in a new tab.
- The text between the tags `Click me! 😎` is what the user clicks.

## What an HTML Element Looks Like

An HTML element usually has:

- An opening tag: `<tagname>`
- Some content: 'Content'
- A closing tag (indicated by slash `/`): `</tagname>`

```html
<tagname>Content</tagname>
```

Here’s an example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
{: .repl }

There’s an **opening tag**, `<p>`, **content** `This is a paragraph.`, and a **closing tag**, `</p>`.

## Changing Style with One Attribute

You can style things right in your HTML using the `style` attribute:

```html
<p style="color: red;">Red text</p>
```
{: .repl }

This tells the browser to display the text in red. CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets** — it’s how we style HTML.

<aside>
Using a `style` attribute works, but 'inline styles' are generally considered a code smell. It’s better to use CSS style rules. (We'll show you how soon)
</aside>

## Using `<span>` to Style Part of a Sentence

What if you want to style just one word inside a paragraph? Use `<span>`. It’s an inline tag, meaning it doesn’t break the line.

```html
<p>span is great for <span style="color: green;">styling</span> small parts of text inline.</p>
```
{: .repl }

## How to Show an Image

To add an image, use the `<img>` tag (short for "image"). It’s a **self-closing tag** (no closing `</img>` needed).

```html
<img src="https://http.cat/200" alt="A cute cat">
```
{: .repl }

- `src`, the file path (or url)
- `alt`, alternative text (shown if the image can’t load)

<aside>
`alt` attributes are also used by screen readers to describe the image.
</aside>

## How HTML Elements Fit Together

HTML is like a family tree. We often describe the relationship between elements as parent, child, and/or sibling.

```html
<div> <!-- grandparent -->
  <p> <!-- parent -->
    <span>Hello!</span> <!-- child -->
  </p>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

When tags go inside other tags we call this 'nesting'.

## Why Extra Spaces Don’t Show Up

HTML doesn’t care about how many spaces or line breaks you add. These two are the same:

```html
<p>This    is
a test.</p>
```
{: .repl }

The browser just shows `This is a test.` ignoring whitespace and newlines.

## How Pages Are Laid Out

HTML gives your page structure. CSS decides how things look and where they go. Together, they build the layout.

### The Default Layout: Flow

By default, HTML elements follow a top-to-bottom flow. Block-level tags (like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`) stack vertically. Inline tags (like `<span>`, `<a>`) sit next to each other in a row.

### What a `<div>` Is For

`<div>` stands for division. It’s a box that holds other elements. It doesn’t show anything by itself, but it helps group things:

```html
<div>
  <p>Inside the box!</p>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

It’s invisible unless you style it, but super useful for grouping content.

## Adding Borders and Rounded Corners

Want to make a box stand out? Add a border with the style attribute:

```html
<div style="border: 1px solid black;">Hello</div>
```
{: .repl }

Make the corners round with:

```html
<div style="border-radius: 10px;">Rounded box</div>
```

These are just a few (of many) CSS properties you can use to style elements.

## Aligning Text Left, Center, or Right

Use `text-align` to move text:

```html
<p style="text-align: center;">Centered text</p>
```
{: .repl }

Try `left`, `center`, or `right`.

## Understanding the Box Around Elements

Every element in HTML is treated like a box. This is called the box model.

![](assets/box-model.png)

- **Content**: The actual text or image
- **Padding**: Space inside the box
- **Border**: The edge of the box
- **Margin**: Space outside the box

## How to Write CSS Style Rules

Instead of putting styles in the tag (inline), you can write them separately:

```html
<style>
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

This text remains black.

<p>This text is now blue.</p>
```
{: .repl }

This turns all text in a `<p>` tag blue.

## Choosing What to Style with CSS

You can tell CSS which elements to style using selectors:

```html

<style>
  /* all paragraphs */
  p { 
    color: red;
  }

  /* an element with id="main" */
  #main {
    font-size: 20px;
  } 

  /* anything with class="box" */
  .box {
    border: 1px solid;
  }
</style>

<div id="main" class="box">

  <p>CSS Selectors are fun!</p>

</div>
```

## Making Layouts with Flexbox

Flexbox is a layout tool that helps you arrange boxes in rows or columns.

```html
<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="border: 2px solid black">One</div>
  <div style="border: 2px solid red">Two</div>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

Note how the boxes sit next to each other instead of stacking.

### Moving Items Side to Side

Use `justify-content` to control horizontal space (left, right, or center).

```html
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <div>Centered</div>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

Other options: `center`, `space-around`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`.

### Lining Items Up Top to Bottom

Use `align-items` to control vertical alignment.

```html
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p> with a paragraph vertically aligned</p>
</div>
```
{: .repl }

This is helpful when boxes have different heights.
